Tumor Raider (TR) is a FPS game made with Unity

## Game Concept
Tumor Raider (pun intended) is a simple single player FPS action game. A player is searching and destroying “cancer cells” in a maze (representing human body). Game play is timed and player wins if he gets all the cells destroyed in allotted time.

Game's target audience are young adults that are fighting cancer. Or anyone who likes FPS games.
